/**
 * #1 — Job-result fetch/focus decision (pure, unit-tested).
 *
 * Clicking a job-completion notification (or a job chip) should NOT blindly re-run an agent turn
 * every time. The decision, addressed by job id:
 *
 *   - FOCUS   — a render tab for this job already exists → just focus it. This is the only
 *               "success cache": we focus-instead-of-fetch ONLY when a real, rendered tab exists,
 *               so a failed/empty fetch is never mistaken for done.
 *   - SUPPRESS— a fetch for this job was dispatched very recently (in-flight window) → drop the
 *               repeat so rapid/double clicks don't fan out into duplicate turns/tabs.
 *   - FETCH   — first click, OR a retry after the in-flight window elapsed. Because a FAILED or
 *               empty fetch leaves NO tab, a later click naturally re-fetches — that is the
 *               recovery path. (The Jobs-panel "Results" button is an always-on manual re-fetch.)
 *
 * Keeping this pure means the failure/recovery edge cases are testable without React/AWS.
