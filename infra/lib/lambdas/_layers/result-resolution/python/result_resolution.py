"""Deterministic resolution of a finished node/job output into a typed record.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``get_plan_results`` used to hand the orchestrator each node's RAW recorded
output: an ``s3://`` ref for an M2C node, or ``{"request_id": ...}`` for a fal
queue node. Its docstring made that a contract -- the agent should "feed any
s3:// refs it finds to read_result_files", and queue submissions were surfaced
"verbatim". The cost was paid on every retrieval:

  * one "retrieve the results" turn became 1-3 further tool calls PER NODE, so a
    four-node plan took ~38 steps and two minutes;
  * every one of those tool results passed the render hook, so session 842bb417
    produced 10 render manifests for 4 analyses, of which only 8 surfaced -- and
    the two dropped ones included the single richest view in the run
    (``video-annotations``, 5 identities, 40 face boxes);
  * three of the eight tabs that DID surface were empty ``generic-preview``
    manifests, because a reader and a presigned-url vendor were being treated as
    artifact producers;
  * worst, the model was left GUESSING endpoint ids. In one run it tried variant
    after variant of ``get_job_result`` and collected 404/405s, then reported the
    video "unreachable" -- when the rule for deriving that endpoint already
    existed server-side and had been fixed three separate times.

Resolution is not a judgement call, so it does not belong in a model turn. This
module does it in code, once, at settle -- off the interactive path, durable, and
re-fetchable without re-resolving.

WHERE IT RUNS
-------------
Shipped as a Lambda layer so ONE copy serves both consumers:

  * the plan chainer, at plan settle (``_mark_run_complete``), which already
    fires exactly once per plan for SUCCEEDED *and* FAILED and already holds
    every node's status;
  * the polling worker, at job terminal, so a lone async job with no plan
    produces the same artifact shape.

A layer rather than a copy in each bundle: both lambdas are packaged with
``lambda.Code.fromAsset(<dir>)`` and have no bundling step, so a shared file
would have to be duplicated -- and duplication is precisely how the endpoint rule
came to be fixed three times in three places. The module name is also deliberately
unique: the two bundles both already define ``handler`` and ``gateway_invoker``,
and a ``sys.path`` insert lets whichever imports first shadow the other.

THE CONTRACT
------------
``resolve_node(...)`` NEVER raises and NEVER returns None. A node whose
resolution fails comes back as ``kind="error"`` carrying the reason, because a
plan where three of four nodes worked must still produce a usable artifact --
and because today a failed plan yields nothing at all, which is how a failure
stays invisible.

    ``import_artifact(src_bucket, src_key, relpath) -> url_or_none`` (injected, so this module
    stays boto3-free) copies a DELIVERABLE that lives in another bucket (the M2C proxy) into our
    own bucket and returns a permanent CloudFront url. Without it, deliverables come back as
    ``s3://`` refs the browser can't fetch — so metadata files couldn't be downloaded and audio
    couldn't play inline. Bounded and best-effort: only role output/analysis (never the source
    canvas), only ``s3://`` urls (https are already resolved/ours), capped at MAX_AUTO_IMPORTS,
    and a copy failure leaves the original ``s3://`` ref untouched.
