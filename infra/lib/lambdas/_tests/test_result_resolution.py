"""The resolver must be deterministic, total, and never sink the aggregate.

These pin the three things that were actually broken in production:

  1. the endpoint rule (three separate fixes, and still left to the model to
     guess -- one run tried variant after variant of get_job_result, collected
     404/405s, and reported a video that fal had already produced as
     "unreachable");
  2. that a node which cannot be resolved degrades to kind="error" instead of
     failing the whole call, because today a failed plan produces nothing at all;
  3. that only DISPLAYABLE media becomes an artifact -- feeding status urls and
     api endpoints to the renderer is what produced empty players.
