# Render: speaker diarization (catalog declaration)

Projects a diarization result onto **per-speaker lanes** — one row per speaker, each turn a
segment on that row (`group=speaker_id`). No duration is declared on purpose: `total_speech_sec`
is the SUM of speaking turns, not the media length, so the audio track's measured duration is
authoritative; declaring it would compress the timeline and misplace every turn.

When the source video is known it is the FIRST track, beside any per-speaker audio the job
emitted — the audio-only trim used for stems does not apply to a diarization view.

Shape:
```json
{ "num_global_speakers": 2, "num_sentences_total": 37,
  "diarization": [ { "start": 26.978, "end": 29.318, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00" } ] }
```
