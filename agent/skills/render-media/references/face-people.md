# Render: identified people (catalog declaration)

Projects `facemetadata.json` — the canonical face output — into **per-person appearance lanes**
plus a **who-was-found table** and a thumbnail gallery.

**This is the no-geometry FALLBACK face view.** It is selected when only `facemetadata.json`
(people + appearances, no box geometry) is present. When `facegroup.json` / `face_tracks.json`
carry box geometry, `render-face-recognition` wins instead — the content selector ranks a box
overlay first (`score = (has_boxes, …)`) — and it `subsumes` this view.

Two shape rules the frontmatter encodes:
- **Appearances are milliseconds** (`units=ms`): `62996` → `62.996s`.
- **Spans belong to the person, not the file** (`lanes` names the entity and its span list), so
  each person keeps their own row.

`duration_sec` is authoritative (e.g. 300.1s vs the 600s fallback).
