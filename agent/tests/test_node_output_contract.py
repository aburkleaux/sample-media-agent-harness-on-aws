"""A node must produce what it declared, or it has not completed.

The mux failure that was reported three times was never silent. The node said so:

    "I cannot complete the merge step... Calling it and claiming it merged the music
     track would be fabricating a result the tool cannot produce."

It declared output_type "s3_uri" and output_key "final_video", returned that prose, and
was recorded status="completed" -- because status was "completed" unless the agent
raised. The plan then reported SUCCEEDED with no merged file, and a user had to read the
node's artifacts by hand to discover the merge never happened.

Checked against the node's OWN declaration, not a list of node names.
