"""Short-lived S3 credentials for the code sandbox, scoped to one (project, session).

asset-lineage Phase 3 (b), design §9.2. The code interpreter sandbox runs MODEL-AUTHORED code under one
execution role shared by every actor, project and session. This module assumes ``SandboxScopedS3Role``
(``SANDBOX_SCOPED_ROLE_ARN``, from RuntimeConfigSecret) with STS session tags ``project_id`` /
``session_id``; that role's policy uses ``${aws:PrincipalTag/...}`` so the credentials can write ONLY
``projects/<pid>/sessions/<sid>/*`` and ``artifacts/<sid>/*`` and read only ``projects/<pid>/*`` plus
legacy ``artifacts/*``. No delete anywhere.

The credentials are delivered OUT OF BAND (:func:`injection_code`, run by the harness through the
interpreter client, never through the model's tool input), as a ``~/.aws/credentials`` ``[default]``
profile. The 2026-10-09 staging probe showed why that is enough: the sandbox has NO ``AWS_*`` env vars,
its ambient credentials resolve as ``iam-role``, ``~`` is writable, and once the file exists boto3 in
the kernel AND in ``executeCommand`` shells resolves ``shared-credentials-file`` first.

Never logs a credential value. :func:`credentials_for` returns ``None`` on failure; :func:`install` — what
every sandbox caller uses — turns any failure into :class:`SandboxCredentialsError` and the caller FAILS
CLOSED: since B2 the sandbox's own execution role has no artifact/project S3 access, so a cell is never
run on it in place of the scoped credentials.
