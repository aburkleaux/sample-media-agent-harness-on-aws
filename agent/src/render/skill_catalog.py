"""Render skill CATALOG — the single reader/parser for render-* skill declarations.

Extracted from ``render_agent`` so the declaration reader (frontmatter parse +
tool→skill lookup + the ``deliverable:`` output contract) can be reused WITHOUT
importing the render-agent runtime. Importing ``render_agent`` pulls in
``task_agent`` and therefore spins up a code-interpreter session, the job
registry and the gateway registry — far too heavy for the render-artifacts hook,
which needs the deliverable contract at BUFFER time (in the main/task runtime) to
decide whether a byproduct output should open its own render tab.

Keeping the parser here — and importing these same symbols back into
``render_agent`` — means there is ONE parser, not two that drift.

Nothing in this module has import-time side effects beyond creating a lazy S3
client (only when a skills bucket is configured), so it is safe to import from a
hot path.

                   never collapse unrelated deliverables.
