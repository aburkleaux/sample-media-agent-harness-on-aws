"""Shared implementation of the canonical lifecycle operations.

The four category CRUD modules (``skill_crud``, ``specialty_crud``,
``workflow_crud``, ``tool_collection_crud``) all expose the same five
canonical operations — Promote, Share, Deprecate, Clone, Rollback — and
the implementation is identical except for the category constant and the
model class. To keep the CRUD layer a thin dispatch shell, the actual
operation bodies live here and are invoked from each CRUD with its
category constant.

Task 3.1 lands the Promote helper. Task 3.2 adds Share. Task 3.3 adds
Deprecate. Tasks 3.4–3.5 will follow with Clone and Rollback.

Per the design's "Promote (sequence)" diagram:

  1. Look up the draft via ``AssetIndex.get(USER#u#DRAFTS, <cat>#<id>#draft)``.
     Missing or owned by a different actor ⇒ ``NotFoundOrForbidden``.
  2. Determine the new ``(published_id, version)``:
       - new lineage:      uuid4(), version=1
       - existing lineage: max(query_lineage(published_id).version) + 1
  3. Render the target prefix from
     ``derive_record_prefix(scope, owner, category, published_id, version)``.
  4. ``S3UserFilesTool.copy_prefix_absolute(draft.s3_prefix → target_prefix)``.
  5. Build the new published :class:`AssetCommon` row with
     ``status="published"``, ``current=true``, ``scope_history`` initialized
     to one entry, ``promoted_from = draft_id``, and ``publish_policy``.
  6. ``AssetIndex.transact_write([Put new published, optionally Update
     prior current to current=false, Update draft.lastPublishedAs])``.
  7. On ``TransactionCanceledException``: run ``delete_prefix_absolute``
     to remove the orphan target prefix. Compensating-delete failure
     raises :class:`CompensationFailedError`. Otherwise raise
     :class:`ConflictError`.
  8. Return :class:`Promoted`.

Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10
Properties: 3 (exactly one current per lineage), 4 (Promote round-trip)

    Called once per publish so the resulting version pins its tool set. Without
    this the published row carried bare ids that were re-resolved live at every
    invoke against the owner's **mutable** working-copy collection rows — so
    editing a draft collection silently changed the behaviour of every already
    published version (including historical ones restored by rollback) and
    silently widened the external allowlist, with no publish, review, or version
    bump. ``_build_published_asset``'s docstring promised the snapshot captured
    the FULL config; for tools it did not.

    Reads the same rows the invoke path used to read: the owner's flat
    ``USER#<actor>#OWNED`` partition. Tool collections have no published form to
    prefer (the category is absent from :data:`_VERSIONED_CATEGORIES`), so the
    working copy is the only source there has ever been.

    Raises rather than skipping an unresolvable id. The alternative is worse than
    the bug being fixed: omitting it would freeze the loss permanently into an
    immutable version, where today's live resolution at least recovers if the
    collection comes back. Refusing at publish time matches how this function's
    caller already treats an empty artifact prefix — surface it to the author now,
    not as a bare persona at invoke time.

    """Widen the scope of an existing Published_Record.

    Implements the design's "Share (sequence)" diagram. Share preserves
    the ``(published_id, version)`` identity but moves the row across
    partition keys (e.g., ``USER#u#PUBLISHED`` → ``GROUP#g#PUBLISHED``)
    and rewrites its S3 prefix to match the new scope. Only the four
    versioned categories participate (Skill, SpecialtyAgent, Workflow);
    tool-collections are flat and remain private in this sprint.

    Sequence:

      1. Look up the source row via ``query_lineage(published_id)`` and
         find the matching ``version``. Missing ⇒ ``NotFoundOrForbidden``.
      2. Authz: ``ctx.actor_id`` must be in
         ``source.publish_policy.{owner_ids ∪ contributor_ids}``
         (Requirement 5.6, Property 8).
      3. Validate scope ordering: if
         ``_SCOPE_ORDER[new_scope] <= _SCOPE_ORDER[source.scope]`` the
         operation is rejected with :class:`ScopeNarrowingError` BEFORE
         any S3 or AssetIndex mutation (Requirement 5.5).
      4. If ``new_scope == "group"`` require non-empty ``group_ids``;
         if ``new_scope == "org"`` require ``org_id`` (Requirement 5.4).
      5. Resolve the target prefix via :func:`derive_record_prefix` and
         the target PK via :func:`_resolve_owner_keys`.
      6. **S3 first**: ``copy_prefix_absolute(source.s3_prefix →
         target_prefix)``. S3 precedes the AssetIndex transaction so a
         failed transaction can compensate by deleting the target.
      7. **TransactWriteItems**: Delete source row at
         ``(source_pk, source_sk)`` with condition
         ``scope = :old_scope`` (defense in depth against a concurrent
         Share); Put target row at ``(target_pk, target_sk)`` with
         condition ``attribute_not_exists(PK)``. Both rows share the
         same SK (same ``category#publishedId#version``); only the PK
         differs.
      8. On ``TransactionCanceledException``: run compensating
         ``delete_prefix_absolute(target_prefix)`` and raise
         :class:`ConflictError`. On compensation failure raise
         :class:`CompensationFailedError`.
      9. **On success**: post-transaction, run
         ``delete_prefix_absolute(source.s3_prefix)`` to reclaim the old
         prefix. If this fails, log the orphan source prefix but DO NOT
         fail the operation — AssetIndex is correct, consumers read
         from the new prefix, and the janitor cleans up the orphan
         (per the design's "Failure modes" section).

    Args:
        ctx: The request context. ``ctx.actor_id`` is the principal for
            both authz and the appended scopeHistory entry.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.
        s3: ``S3UserFilesTool`` instance (only ``copy_prefix_absolute``
            and ``delete_prefix_absolute`` are used; cross-actor moves
            cannot use the actor-scoped methods).
        category: Singular AssetIndex category. Must be one of
            ``"skill"``, ``"specialty-agent"``, ``"workflow"``.
        published_id: Lineage id of the row to widen.
        version: Specific version to widen. Share addresses one row at a
            time; widening a whole lineage is the caller's responsibility.
        new_scope: Target scope. Must be strictly greater than the
            source scope under ``private < group < org``.
        group_ids: Required when ``new_scope == "group"``; appended to
            the new ``scopeHistory`` entry. Single-element list is
            expected (matches Promote semantics).
        org_id: Required when ``new_scope == "org"``.

    Returns:
        :class:`Shared` with the unchanged ``published_id`` and
        ``version`` plus the new ``s3_prefix`` and ``scope``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Category is not a versioned category, or
            scope/group_ids/org_id combination is malformed, or no
            source version matches.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: The source row does not exist.
        AuthorityDenied: ``ctx.actor_id`` is not in the source row's
            ``publishPolicy``.
        ScopeNarrowingError: The requested ``new_scope`` is not strictly
            wider than the source scope.
        ConflictError: The DynamoDB transaction cancelled (typically a
            concurrent Share or scope precondition mismatch). The
            compensating ``delete_prefix_absolute`` was successful.
        CompensationFailedError: The transaction cancelled AND the
            compensating delete itself failed; an orphan target prefix
            exists with no AssetIndex row.

    """Mark a published version as deprecated.

    Implements the design's "Deprecate" section. Deprecate is the only
    canonical operation that does NOT mutate S3: artifacts are retained
    so pinned references continue to resolve (Requirement 6.4). The
    operation is therefore a single ``TransactWriteItems`` against
    AssetIndex with no compensating-action path.

    Sequence:

      1. Load the full lineage via
         :meth:`AssetIndex.query_lineage`. If empty or the requested
         ``version`` is missing, raise :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden`
         (Requirement 6.1; "missing" is treated the same as "not yours"
         to avoid existence disclosure).
      2. Authz: ``ctx.actor_id`` must be in
         ``target.publish_policy.{owner_ids ∪ contributor_ids}``
         (Requirement 6.5, Property 8). Otherwise raise
         :class:`AuthorityDenied`.
      3. Build a ``TransactWriteItems`` payload:

         * **Update target row**: SET ``status = "deprecated"``,
           ``current = false``, ``updatedAt = now_ms``. PK/SK come from
           :func:`_scope_keys_for_published`.
         * **If target was current AND a non-deprecated other version
           remains**: append a second Update on the highest such other
           version setting ``current = true`` and bumping ``updatedAt``,
           with precondition ``current = :false`` so a concurrent
           Promote/Rollback that already flipped it cancels this
           transaction.
         * **If no non-deprecated version remains**: omit the second
           update; the lineage simply has no current (Requirement 6.3,
           Property 3 second clause).

      4. Call :meth:`AssetIndex.transact_write`. On
         ``TransactionCanceledException`` raise :class:`ConflictError`.
         No compensating action is needed because there are no S3
         mutations.

    Args:
        ctx: The request context. ``ctx.actor_id`` is the principal for
            the authority gate.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.
        category: Singular AssetIndex category. Must be one of
            ``"skill"``, ``"specialty-agent"``, ``"workflow"``.
        published_id: Lineage id of the version to deprecate.
        version: Specific positive-int version to deprecate.

    Returns:
        :class:`Deprecated` with the unchanged ``published_id`` and
        ``version`` plus the post-state ``new_current_version`` (the
        version now marked ``current=true``, or ``None`` when no
        non-deprecated version remains).

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``category`` is not a versioned category, or
            ``version`` is not a positive int.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: Lineage is empty or the requested version
            is not present.
        AuthorityDenied: ``ctx.actor_id`` is not in the target row's
            ``publish_policy``.
        ConflictError: The DynamoDB transaction cancelled (typically a
            concurrent mutation already moved the current pointer).

    """Clone a Published_Record into a new Draft owned by ``ctx.actor_id``.

    Implements the design's "Clone" section. Clone reads the source
    Published_Record directly (visibility is enforced by the Lab handler
    *before* this CRUD method is reached, per the design); generates a
    fresh ``draft_id``; copies the source's S3 prefix to a new draft
    prefix under the actor's drafts partition; and writes a single
    AssetIndex draft row with ``recordType=draft``,
    ``cloned_from=(publishedId, version)``, and ``promoted_from=None``.

    Sequence:

      1. Load the lineage via :meth:`AssetIndex.query_lineage` and
         locate the matching ``version``. Empty lineage or missing
         version ⇒ :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden` (Requirement 7.4 —
         visibility checks delegated to the handler, but we still treat
         a missing source row as not-found rather than disclosing
         existence).
      2. Generate ``draft_id = uuid4()`` and render
         ``target_prefix = users/<actor>/drafts/<cat>/<draft_id>/`` via
         :func:`derive_record_prefix`.
      3. **S3 first**: ``copy_prefix_absolute(source.s3_prefix →
         target_prefix)``. S3 precedes the AssetIndex put so a failed
         put can compensate by deleting the target (matches the Promote
         compensating-delete pattern).
      4. Build the new Draft row via :func:`_build_cloned_draft` and
         persist via :meth:`AssetIndex.put` with
         ``owner_user_id=ctx.actor_id``. Clone is a single-row insert,
         so :meth:`transact_write` is not used.
      5. **On put failure**: run compensating
         ``delete_prefix_absolute(target_prefix)``. If compensation
         itself fails, raise :class:`CompensationFailedError` carrying
         the orphan prefix; otherwise re-raise the original exception.

    Authority check: NONE. Clone does not require authority on the
    source row's ``publish_policy`` — the result is a *new* Draft owned
    by ``ctx.actor_id``, not a mutation of the source. This mirrors the
    design's "Clone" sequence, which omits the authority gate that
    Share / Deprecate / Rollback enforce.

    Args:
        ctx: The request context. ``ctx.actor_id`` is the owner of the
            new draft.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.

            and ``delete_prefix_absolute`` are used; cross-actor copies
            cannot use the actor-scoped methods.
        category: Singular AssetIndex category. Must be one of
            ``"skill"``, ``"specialty-agent"``, ``"workflow"``.
            Tool-collections are flat and out of scope; their CRUD
            wrapper raises :class:`NotImplementedError` directly without
            calling this helper.
        published_id: Lineage id of the source Published_Record.
        version: Specific positive-int version of the source to clone.

    Returns:
        :class:`Cloned` with the new ``draft_id``, the rendered
        ``s3_prefix`` of the draft, and a ``cloned_from`` tuple
        ``(published_id, version)`` pointing at the source.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``category`` is not a versioned category, or
            ``version`` is not a positive int.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: The source lineage is empty or the
            requested version is missing.
        CompensationFailedError: The AssetIndex put failed AND the
            compensating ``delete_prefix_absolute`` itself failed,

    """Move the ``current`` pointer of a lineage to a prior version.

    Implements the design's "Rollback" section. Rollback NEVER mutates
    ``status`` (Requirement 8.3) and never touches S3 — artifacts are
    retained so any pinned references continue to resolve. The
    operation is therefore a single ``TransactWriteItems`` against
    AssetIndex with no compensating-action path.

    Custom Agents (Requirement 8.6): rollback only flips the ``current``
    pointer between existing immutable snapshot rows; it does NOT
    reconstruct the row or its category-specific payload. Because
    ``_build_published_asset`` captures the FULL Custom Agent config
    (``model``, ``tool_collections``, ``integration_config``) into each
    snapshot at publish time, restoring an earlier version's config on
    rollback is automatic — the target snapshot already carries the
    extended integration settings it was published with.

    Sequence:

      1. Load the lineage via :meth:`AssetIndex.query_lineage`. If
         empty, raise :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden` (Requirement 8.4 —
         missing lineage is treated the same as not-yours to avoid
         existence disclosure).
      2. Locate the current row (where ``current=true``). If no current
         row exists, raise :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden`: a lineage with
         no current pointer cannot be "rolled back" to anything.
      3. Authz: ``ctx.actor_id`` must be in
         ``current_row.publish_policy.{owner_ids ∪ contributor_ids}``
         (Requirement 8.5, Property 8). Otherwise raise
         :class:`AuthorityDenied` BEFORE any mutation.
      4. Resolve the rollback target:

         * ``to_version is None`` → select
           ``max(v.version for v in lineage if v.version <
           current.version and v.status != "deprecated")``. If no such
           version exists, raise :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden`
           (Requirement 8.1).
         * ``to_version`` supplied → find that version in the lineage.
           Missing ⇒ :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden`. Deprecated ⇒
           :class:`ValueError` (Requirement 8.4 explicitly: deprecated
           targets are a validation error).

      5. Reject a no-op (target == current). Rolling back to the
         already-current version is a validation error rather than a
         silent success.
      6. Build a ``TransactWriteItems`` payload:

         * **Update target row**: SET ``current=true``,
           ``updatedAt=now_ms`` with precondition ``current=:false``
           (lost-update protection against a concurrent
           Promote/Rollback that already flipped it).
         * **Update prior current row**: SET ``current=false``,
           ``updatedAt=now_ms`` with precondition ``current=:true``
           (lost-update protection against a concurrent Deprecate that
           already cleared it).

         Neither Update touches ``status`` (Requirement 8.3).

      7. Call :meth:`AssetIndex.transact_write`. On
         ``TransactionCanceledException`` raise :class:`ConflictError`.
         No compensating action is needed — there are no S3 mutations.

    Args:
        ctx: The request context. ``ctx.actor_id`` is the principal for
            the authority gate.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.
        category: Singular AssetIndex category. Must be one of
            ``"skill"``, ``"specialty-agent"``, ``"workflow"``.
            Tool-collections are flat and out of scope; their CRUD
            wrapper raises :class:`NotImplementedError` directly without
            calling this helper.
        published_id: Lineage id whose current pointer should be moved.
        to_version: Optional explicit target version. When ``None`` the
            highest non-deprecated version strictly less than the
            current version is selected automatically.

    Returns:
        :class:`RolledBack` with the unchanged ``published_id`` plus
        the ``new_current_version`` (the resolved target) and
        ``prior_current_version`` (the version that was current
        before).

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``category`` is not a versioned category, or the
            requested ``to_version`` is deprecated, or the rollback
            target equals the current version.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: Lineage is empty, has no current row, the
            requested ``to_version`` is not present, or no prior
            non-deprecated version is available for an implicit

        AuthorityDenied: ``ctx.actor_id`` is not in the current row's
            ``publish_policy``.

    """Toggle the Req 16 external-access gate for an agent lineage.

    This is the Owner's revoke/re-enable control. It writes
    ``externalAccessEnabled`` onto EVERY row of the agent's lineage — the
    working copy (if one exists) AND every immutable version snapshot — in a
    single ``TransactWriteItems`` so the gate behaves as a per-lineage
    revocation record rather than per-snapshot state.

    Why write every row (Property 16 / Req 16.2, 16.3): rollback
    (:func:`rollback_asset`) only flips the ``current`` pointer between
    existing snapshot rows and NEVER touches ``externalAccessEnabled``. If the
    gate were set on just the current row, rolling back to an older snapshot
    (published while access was still enabled) would silently re-grant revoked
    access. By stamping the flag uniformly across the whole version history,
    whichever snapshot rollback makes current continues to read the revoked
    state until the Owner explicitly re-enables. The flag lives OUTSIDE each
    snapshot's immutable ``integration_config``, so this is consistent with
    keeping the published config frozen.

    Effect is immediate and independent of publishing (Req 16.1): the proxy
    resolves the gate at request time off the resolved current row.

    Only ``specialty-agent`` lineages carry an external-access gate (external
    invocation is a Custom Agent concept); other categories are rejected.

    Args:
        ctx: The request context. ``ctx.actor_id`` authorizes the toggle.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.
        category: Must be ``"specialty-agent"``.
        published_id: Lineage id (== working-copy asset_id) of the agent.
        enabled: ``False`` revokes external access; ``True`` re-enables it.

    Returns:
        :class:`ExternalAccessSet` echoing the lineage id, the new
        ``enabled`` state, and how many rows were updated.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``category`` is not ``"specialty-agent"``.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: No working copy and no lineage rows exist for the
            actor, or the actor is not authorized on the published lineage.

         which is what finds versions spread across
         ``USER#u#VERSIONS`` / ``GROUP#g#SHARED`` / ``ORG#o#SHARED``, plus the
         working copy from the actor's OWNED partition. Neither present ⇒
         :class:`NotFoundOrForbidden`.
      3. Authorize every version (:func:`_authorize_purge`).
      4. Validate every S3 prefix (:func:`_purge_prefix_or_raise`).
      5. Delete rows, highest version first, one transaction per version:
         the row ``Delete`` plus — for org-scoped versions — a ``Deprecated``
         outbox row so the Registry projection converges to non-discoverable.
      6. Delete the working copy row and its prefix.
      7. Sweep the version prefixes.

    Steps 1–4 complete before any write, so an unauthorized or malformed
    lineage is rejected without partial destruction.

    No ``ConditionExpression`` on the deletes: ``attribute_exists(PK)`` would
    make a resumed purge cancel on rows a previous attempt already removed,
    turning an idempotent retry into a permanent failure. A DynamoDB delete of a
    missing key is a no-op, which is exactly the semantics a retry wants.

    Highest version first so that if the row phase fails partway, the surviving
    prefix of the lineage is the LOWER versions — both
    ``task_agent._pick_lineage_row`` and ``specialty_crud._pick_published_row``
    fall back to "highest non-deprecated", so degradation is monotonically
    downward rather than to an arbitrary survivor.

    Args:
        ctx: Request context; ``ctx.actor_id`` is the purge principal.
        asset_index: Single-table AssetIndex wrapper.
        s3: Artifact tool, used only for prefix deletion.
        category: Must be ``"specialty-agent"``.
        published_id: Lineage id to destroy.
        hits: Reference-scan findings to record on the result.
        partial: Sources the reference scan could not read.

    Returns:
        :class:`Purged`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Category is not purgeable, or a stored prefix is unusable.
        PrefixMismatchError: A stored prefix disagrees with the canonical
            grammar for its row.
        NotFoundOrForbidden: Nothing to purge under this id for this actor.
        AuthorityDenied: The actor lacks authority on at least one version.
        ConflictError: A delete transaction cancelled; earlier versions may
            already be gone and a retry converges.
